                <li>        - 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

        <div class="instructions">
            <b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>        1. In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar and yeast in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the activated yeast mixture, yogurt, melted ghee or butter, and milk.
        3. Mix everything together until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
        4. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.
        5. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into small equal-sized portions. Roll each portion into an oval or round shape, about 1/4 inch thick.
        6. Heat a skillet or tawa over medium-high heat. Place the rolled naan on the skillet and cook for about 1-2 minutes until bubbles start to form on the surface.
        7. Flip the naan and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until it puffs up and gets golden brown spots.
        8. Remove the naan from the skillet and brush it with melted ghee or butter for extra flavor.
        9. Repeat the process for the remaining dough portions.
        10. Serve the hot and delicious plain naan with your favorite curries or enjoy it on its own!
