        <b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar and yeast in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the activated yeast mixture, yogurt, melted ghee or butter, and milk.</li>
            <li>Mix everything together until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into small equal-sized portions.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the finely chopped onions, cilantro, and cumin seeds.</li>
            <li>Take one portion of dough and flatten it using your hands or a rolling pin. Place a spoonful of the onion-cilantro mixture on one half of the flattened dough.</li>
            <li>Fold the other half of the dough over the filling, sealing the edges well.</li>
            <li>Roll out the stuffed dough into an oval or round shape, about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li> Heat a skillet or tawa over medium-high heat. Place the rolled Navabi naan on the skillet and cook for about 1-2 minutes until bubbles start to form on the surface.</li>
            <li> Flip the naan and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until it puffs up and gets golden brown spots.</li>
            <li> Remove the naan from the skillet and brush it with melted ghee or butter for extra flavor.</li>
            <li> Repeat the process for the remaining dough portions.</li>
            <li> Serve the hot and flavorful Navabi naan with your favorite curries or enjoy it on its own!</li>
