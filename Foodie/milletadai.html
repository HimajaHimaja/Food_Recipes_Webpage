        <b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b> Take all the ingredients of the Adai (Items 1-8),and grind to a somewhat coarse and thick
        consistency
        You may adjust the consistency after grinding by adding a little water if need be.
        Heat the griddle (Dosa Pan) and spread a rather thick disc of Adai batter.
        As soon as the Adai is spread out on the pan, sprinkle the cut onion, green chillies on the Adai. Put some Oil
        or Ghee along the edges and let the Adai get brown and roasted on a medium flame.
        When the Adai is browned on one side, flip it carefully and spread a little oil or ghee again along the edges.

        The Adai is crisp and ready. Serve hot along with any chutney of your choice.
