        <b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>
                Step 1: In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
        Step 2: Add the plain yogurt and melted butter to the bowl. Mix well.
        Step 3: Gradually add the warm milk to the mixture and knead until a soft dough forms.
        Step 4: Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 1 hour.
        Step 5: After the resting time, divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a round shape using a rolling pin.
        Step 6: Heat a non-stick pan or tawa over medium heat.
        Step 7: Place the rolled naan on the hot pan and cook for about 1 minute or until bubbles start to appear.
        Step 8: Flip the naan and cook for another minute, pressing gently with a spatula to ensure it cooks evenly.
        Step 9: Remove the naan from the pan and brush it with butter.
        Step 10: Repeat the process with the remaining dough portions.
        Step 11: Serve the butter naan warm and enjoy it with your favorite curries or dips!
