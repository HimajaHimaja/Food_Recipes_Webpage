                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

            <b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>Heat butter until it melts in a saucepan or a pot. Keep the heat to low or medium-low.
            Add bay leaves and sauté for a few seconds. Add chopped onions and garlic. Stir and sauté until onions
            soften for about 3 to 4 minutes.
            Add chopped tomatoes and salt. Mix well.<br>
            Cover pan and simmer on a low to medium-low heat until tomatoes soften or for about 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
            There is no need to add water. But do keep an eye when the tomatoes are simmering. If the liquids dry up
            then add a splash of water and
            continue cooking.<br>
            After the tomatoes have softened, remove from the heat and cool. Take out the bay leaves and discard. <br>
