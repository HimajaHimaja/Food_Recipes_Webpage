       <b> INSTRUCTIONS:</b>
Add the rest of the ingredients to the Wheat Flour, knead the Dough well and then make into equal-sized balls. Cover them with a wet cloth
and let it rest for 30 minutes.
Make a smooth paste of Sweet Corn, Green Chillies, Green Coriander, Ginger, Garlic and Ajwain in a mixie.
Heat oil in a pan, add Cumin seeds, Asafoetida and Onions and cook until onions turn soft.
Add the Sweet Corn paste to the cooked Onions and fry until the moisture is reduced and comes together. Take it out and let it cool.
Take the Wheat Flour balls and knead again and roll into a thin spread. Then keep the Sweet Corn stuffing inside and seal the edges.
Take the stuffed Dough ball, sprinkle a little Wheat Flour. Then spread the stuffing equally with your fingers. Then roll it gently with 
a Rolling Pin without uneven lumps so that the Parathas donâ€™t break open.
When the pan is very hot, put the Parantha and roast it on both sides applying oil.
        
The Crisp Paranthas should be eaten hot with cool Curd and Mango Pickle.
