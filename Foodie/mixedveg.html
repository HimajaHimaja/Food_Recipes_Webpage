            <b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>Heat 2 tsp of oil and add Cumin Seeds and roast. Then add grated Green Chillies, chopped
            Onions and fry on a low flame until the raw taste goes.
            Then add the chopped Cabbage, Carrot, Beans and fry for 2-3 minutes.
            When moisture goes out of the Carrots, add Salt, Mirchi, Chilli Flakes, Cumin Powder and Garam Masala. Mix
            well and fry for another minute.<br>
            <br>
            Now add the soft boiled Potatoes. Mix well and switch off the stove. Add the Lemon Juice and Green Coriander
            and mix well. Let cool.
            Once cool, make small balls out of the Vegetable mixture. Keep them in the fridge for 30 minutes.
            Now add Salt to Maida and make a mixture of thin inconsistency.<br>
            <br>
            Then dip the vegetable balls in the Maida batter and coat them with Bread crumbs powder 3-4 times. Then
            stick an Ice Cream stick into the ball and gently press it gently to fit the stick.
            Now, put them in hot oil and leave them for 2 minutes without turning. Then slowly turn them over and fry
            them.<br>
            Put the Lollipops in Oil and fry until golden on a medium flame.

            When they are fried crispy, serve with Tomato Sauce.
