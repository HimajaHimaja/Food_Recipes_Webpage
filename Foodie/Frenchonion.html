            <b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot, melt the butter and olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced onions to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are caramelized and
                    golden brown. This usually takes about 30-40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the sugar over the onions and continue to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring
                    occasionally.</li>
                <li>Add the beef broth, chicken broth, white wine (if using), dried thyme, salt, and pepper to the pot.
                    Bring the mixture to a simmer <br>and let it cook for about 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld
                    together.</li>
                <li>While the soup is simmering, preheat your oven's broiler.</li>
                <li>Ladle the soup into oven-safe bowls and place a few baguette slices on top of each bowl.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the grated cheese generously over the baguette slices.</li>
                <li>Place the bowls under the broiler for a few minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the bowls from the oven (they will be hot!) and let them cool for a minute before
                    serving.</li>
                <li> Serve hot and enjoy your delicious bowl of French onion soup.</li>
